## Validation Steps

## Execution Batching

Group todos into small batches to keep each build conversation focused and avoid context overflow.

### Batch 1
- Todo items: 
- Commit checkpoint: yes

### Batch 2
- Todo items: 
- Commit checkpoint: yes

> After completing each batch, commit and push your changes — **including the `plan/` directory** — then start a new conversation for the next batch. Uncommitted plan files (`plan.json`, `plan.md`, etc.) remain in the working tree and may be injected into context by OpenCode, adding unnecessary token overhead. Committing them keeps subsequent sessions clean and focused.

## Blockers And Caveats

## How to Execute

Switch to the `enhance-build` agent and start a new conversation. `enhance-build` will read this handoff and execute one batch at a time with minimal context overhead.

Alternatively, you may use OpenCode's built-in code mode, but `enhance-build` loads fewer files at startup and follows batch checkpoints more strictly, resulting in lower token usage.
